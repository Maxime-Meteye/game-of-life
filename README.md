# Conway's game of life By Maxime Météyé

A game of life running inside your browser, no framework. Native JS only.

## Features

- Random cell generation
- Canvas display
- Modular engine
- Double buffer rendering

## Usage

Just open "index.html" in the browser

## Notes

This project was initialy made in april of 2025 to get more familiar with canvas, the goals were simple : 
- Learn how to draw in a 2d context with canvas
- Make a game of life
- Optimise enough to obtain at least 30fps on my hardware.
- Maintain a modular approach
- And get more familiar with programming in javascript.

This was not made with the intent of learning webgl or libraries such as pixiJs.
A faster and lighter on the cpu result could be achieved by using webgl.
